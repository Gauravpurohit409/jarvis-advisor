          "transcript": "Key discussion points:\n\nRETIREMENT: Sarah ideally retire 58-60, feeling 'burned out' at times from intense Unilever pace. Michael more flexible, enjoys work but wants reduced hours from 60. Want to travel (Australia, NZ, Japan), spend time with future grandchildren. Concerned \u00a350k/year may not be enough - will model \u00a360k scenarios.\n\nPROPERTY: Love Weybridge home, no plans to move unless downsizing in retirement. House valued \u00a3875k (paid \u00a3495k in 2012). Mentioned possible retirement to Winchester (near Sarah's sister Emma) or Devon/Cornwall.\n\nPROTECTION: Both understand importance given mortgage and children. Sarah has excellent employer benefits. Critical gap: Michael has NO critical illness cover and NO income protection. Michael's father died age 68 (heart attack). Michael has hypertension - seemed uncomfortable discussing, Sarah had to encourage sharing. URGENT recommendation for CI cover but expect underwriting issues.\n\nWILLS/LPA: Current wills from 2019, need update. No LPAs in place - significant gap.\n\nINVESTMENTS: Sarah knowledgeable, follows Monevator, read Tim Hale. Comfortable with passive approach. 80/20 equity/bond split appropriate. Michael less engaged but trusts Sarah. His workplace pension in default fund never reviewed - opportunity. Both interested in ESG but not strict ethical.\n\nCHILDREN: Emily (14) very academic, predicted straight As, wants medicine/vet. Oliver (11) more creative like Michael. School fees \u00a32,600/month committed until sixth form. JISAs: Emily \u00a318.4k, Oliver \u00a314.2k.",
